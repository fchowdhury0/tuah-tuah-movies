How to start the database server:

* Make sure nothing is running on local ports 3000 and 3001.

1) Launch the app with the terminal command, "npm start", while in the project directory
2) In the same directory, use the terminal command, "node database/index.js", to start the database server
3) Refresh the app page

The app should be running on local port 3000, and the server should be running on port 3001.
